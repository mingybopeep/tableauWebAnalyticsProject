# Tableau Ads Analytics Project
To demonstrate a Tableau Dashboard, I have created a python script that generates mock data about some online ad campaign impression across mulitple platforms. The data contains fields such as: 

- campaign ID
- timestamp
- location
- clicked 
- amount spent

The data was quickly designed to simulate a 24 hour snapshot of ad performance. 
Once the random data is generated, it is pushed to a google sheet, which is then read in by Tableau.
